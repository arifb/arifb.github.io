      <p>Hi, you've found Arif. I build software for the web and mobile, and am a big advocate of startups.</p>

      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>Until its acquisition in early 2019, I was a partner at <a href="https://codetree.com">Codetree</a>, providing project and issue tracking software for teams writing code. I founded <a href="https://arbourmbo.com">Arbour Medical</a>, a software product that optimizes billing for Canadian Family Physicians. I consult with teams that are looking to build and grow early to mid-stage technology businesses, often in a system and product design capacity, and then always as a builder, writing code.</p>

      <p>My latest pet project is <a href="https://benchinvestor.com">Bench Investor</a> an investment portfolio tracker on steroids. After years of being frustrated with brokers showing me performance numbers that are either vanity metrics or worse, just plain wrong, I built a portfolio tracker that solves those problems and has a focus on annualized total return.</p>

      <p>I'm a full stack engineer with 15 years experience. I'm pragmatic with a focus on speed and iteration rather than on being a purist with a big unveil at the end. Get something out early that stakeholders can see and play with, then adjust. I like to think of myself as someone you can count on to properly define your problem and then, with minimal oversight, make it go away.</p>

      <p>Recently, I've written a lot of React Native targeting mobile. On the web side, I most often build backends in Rails. For key UI interactions and pages I'll use React - but for simple pages, I don't see the win and just use the backend to generate the views.</p>

      <p>I enjoy system design and am of the opinion that lots of pain and battles can be avoided by getting this right. Again, I like to keep things simple until there is a clear win in complicating the architecture.</p>

      <p>I've got plenty of experience in DevOps, leveraging tooling that allows for continuous integration and delivery and also in moving infrastructure to code, allowing servers to be duplicated in repeatable ways.</p>

      <p>Some of my client work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://solesavy.com/">SoleSavy</a> - a community site for sneaker heads. Sole engineer on the iOS and Android apps. Built a web based tool to manage and send all their push notifications across all platforms (40+ slack targets, iOS, Android etc.)</li>

        <li><a href="https://digitalhealthstrategies.com/">Digital Health Strategies</a> - provider of US healthcare digital engagement web-based products. Acted in an CTO capacity as well as lead engineer on the more technically-involved engagements.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.certistay.com">CertiStay</a> - third party safety and security certification for short term rental properties. Brought on early in a builder and product role - roadmapped, specced, and built the iOS React Native app, and Rails backend.</li>

        <li><a href="https://chimp.net">Chimp.net</a> - providing donor-focused tools to manage your charitable giving. Brought on just past napkin-stage with a team of a few and stayed on until the business employed ~50, with revenue greater than $200M. Wrote code and managed product.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.elasticpath.com/">Elastic Path</a> - enterprise-level, e-commerce vendor. Brought on to lead a client engagement that was proving problematic and was behind schedule. Put out the fire and quickly delivered an integration.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Personal</h2>

      <p>I live in Vancouver, British Columbia and was born and raised across the country in Toronto, Ontario. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from McGill University in Montreal and an MBA from Rotman, University of Toronto. Ski, golf, tennis, basketball. I'm game for most activities and sports if they take place in the beauty outdoors.</p>

      <p>Please get in touch, I'd love to hear from you. Email is probably best, <a href="mailto:arif.remove@this.arifb.com">arif+at+arifb.com</a>.</p>
