# Effective Consulting

- Document where you're at when you stop working. No excuses, even if you're only working with 1 client.
- Anyone doing this moderately successfully will talk about always filling in the pipeline. Obviously important but even more so for me has been using estimates as well as verbal/monetary commitments from current clients to know to an accurate degree when your work will be slowing down or drying up.
- Run your own race. By consulting you are choosing to forego big brand name recognition (FAANG etc.) and often working on projects/teams that no one has heard of. Understand that and be OK with it.
