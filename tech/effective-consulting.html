      <h3>Effective Consulting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Document where you're at when you stop working. No excuses, even if you're only working with 1 client.</li>
        <li>Anyone doing this moderately successfully will talk about always filling in the pipeline. Obviously important. But I often get deeply interested in my current work and stop doing this part of the gig. Most consultants don't like selling, and I'm no different, would much rather just always have interesting work to choose from. But you can't escape it and so it's worth mentioning. I've found using estimates as well as verbal/monetary commitments from current clients to know to an accurate degree when your work will be slowing down or drying up is super important to actually getting ass in gear to figure out what a good next move looks like.</li>
