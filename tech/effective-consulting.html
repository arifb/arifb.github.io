      <h3>Effective Consulting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Document where you're at when you stop working. No excuses, even if you're only working with 1 client.</li>
        <li>Anyone doing this moderately successfully will talk about always filling in the pipeline. Obviously important. But I often get deeply interested in my current work and stop doing this part of the gig. Most consultants don't like selling, and I'm no different, would much rather just always have interesting work to choose from. But you can't escape it and so it's worth mentioning. Even in more open-ended gigs, I've found using estimates to elicit verbal/monetary commitments from current clients is super important. To actually get ass in gear I need to know when the gravy train will be slowing down.</li>
