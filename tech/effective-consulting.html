      <h3>Effective Consulting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Document where you're at when you stop working. No excuses, even if you're only working with 1 client.</li>
        <li>Anyone doing this moderately successfully will talk about always filling in the pipeline. Obviously important but even more so for me has been using estimates as well as verbal/monetary commitments from current clients to know to an accurate degree when your work will be slowing down or drying up.</li>
